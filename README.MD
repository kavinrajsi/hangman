## Steps to followed

- The game page must contain the start button to start the game.
- Initially, the image will appear as shown.
- The player has a total of 6 lifelines (chances for wrong answers/guess)
- For every attempt in guessing the words, Total right and wrong guessed letters must appear in the separate sections at the top.
- The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.
- If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins.
- Otherwise, the player will be penalized by adding an element to the diagram.
- On the other hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the system to complete the diagram, the game is also over and the player loses.
- However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, there by completing the word, before the diagram is completed.
- On completion on one level advanced the user to the next level with more difficult words.
- Once each level is completed, display the result with a win or lose status and generate game points accordingly.
- After generating the result, navigate the user back to the game page and restart the game
accordingly.
- The user who guesses more words straight without losing bangs the highest score
